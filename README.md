This project enhances network security by addressing critical vulnerabilities. It includes Network Segmentation to isolate web and data servers, reducing risks of privilege escalation and data theft. Open Ports are secured by proper firewall configuration to prevent various attacks. Password and Lockout Configurations ensure encrypted passwords and access control. Port Security safeguards workstations, servers, and unused ports. Router Hardening involves disabling unnecessary services and setting up IP inspection. Internet Routing is managed with primary and backup routes for reliability. Finally, Access Control Lists filter traffic to protect network interfaces.
